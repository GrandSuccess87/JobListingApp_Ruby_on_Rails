# JobListingApp

Initiating a job listing appliccation built with Ruby on Rails.  I am using Rails to create database migration and MVC framework.

I will add more logic to the files to display more detailed information about the job post and display text output as a link to streamline the application process for the user.  For example, when the user clicks "Apply to this job" it will go to the mail client and pass the job title in the subject line of the e-mail.  This is a relatively simple application that will allow me to practice using Ruby on Rails.
